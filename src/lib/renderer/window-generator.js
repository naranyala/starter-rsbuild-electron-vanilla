    '<p>Security is crucial in Electron applications. Best practices include enabling context isolation, disabling nodeIntegration when possible, and using Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent XSS attacks.</p>',
    '<p>Electron provides access to native OS features through its APIs: file system operations, dialog boxes, notifications, tray icons, clipboard, and more. These APIs bridge the gap between web technologies and desktop functionality.</p>',
    '<p>Electron applications can be packaged for distribution using tools like electron-builder, electron-forge, or electron-packager. These tools create installable executables for Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p>',
    '<p>Performance optimization in Electron involves reducing memory usage, improving startup time, and efficient resource management. Techniques include code splitting, lazy loading, and proper cleanup of event listeners.</p>',

  architecture: [
    '<p>Electron applications follow a multi-process architecture with the Main Process managing application lifecycle and creating browser windows, while Renderer Processes handle UI rendering.</p>',
    '<p>Communication between processes happens via IPC (Inter-Process Communication). This architecture allows for secure separation of concerns while maintaining flexibility.</p>',
    '<p>Security architecture in Electron involves context isolation, proper handling of user input, and restricting access to Node.js APIs in the renderer process.</p>',
    '<p>Application architecture patterns in Electron include using preload scripts to expose limited APIs to the renderer, and maintaining a clear separation between main and renderer responsibilities.</p>',
    '<p>Modern Electron applications often use a modular architecture with separate modules for main process, renderer process, and shared utilities.</p>',
  ],
  security: [
    '<p>Security is crucial in Electron applications. Important practices include: enabling context isolation, disabling nodeIntegration when possible, using CSP (Content Security Policy), validating all input, and sanitizing user-provided content.</p>',
    "<p>Context Isolation is a security feature that ensures that your preload scripts and Electron's internal logic run in a separate context to the website loaded in a WebContents.</p>",
    '<p>Content Security Policy (CSP) helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by allowing you to restrict which resources can be loaded by the page.</p>',
    '<p>Node.js integration in the renderer process should be disabled unless absolutely necessary. When needed, expose only the required APIs through preload scripts.</p>',
    '<p>Always validate and sanitize user input, especially when interacting with the file system or executing external processes.</p>',

  packaging: [
    '<p>Electron applications can be packaged for distribution using tools like electron-builder, electron-forge, or electron-packager. These tools create installable executables for Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p>',

    '<p>Configuration for packaging includes app metadata, icons, installer options, and platform-specific settings. Proper packaging ensures a professional user experience across all platforms.</p>',
    '<p>Code signing is important for distributing Electron applications, especially on macOS and Windows. It verifies the authenticity of the application and prevents tampering.</p>',

    '<p>Common native integrations include file dialogs, system notifications, context menus, and deep OS integration for a native-like experience.</p>',
    '<p>IPC (Inter-Process Communication) is used to communicate between the main and renderer processes. Use ipcMain in the main process and ipcRenderer in the renderer process.</p>',
    '<p>Powerful APIs like app, BrowserWindow, Menu, Tray, and nativeImage provide access to operating system-level functionality.</p>',
    '<p>Preload scripts can be used to expose specific APIs to the renderer process while maintaining security.</p>',

  performance: [
    '<p>Optimizing Electron apps involves reducing memory usage, improving startup time, and efficient resource management. Techniques include code splitting, lazy loading, proper cleanup of event listeners, and optimizing asset loading.</p>',
    '<p>Memory management is crucial in Electron applications. Avoid memory leaks by properly cleaning up event listeners, timers, and references when windows are closed.</p>',
    '<p>Startup performance can be improved by optimizing the main process initialization and deferring non-critical operations until after the application has loaded.</p>',
    '<p>Renderer process performance benefits from standard web optimization techniques: efficient JavaScript, optimized images, and proper use of web workers for heavy computations.</p>',
    '<p>Monitor performance with Chrome DevTools and consider using native modules for CPU-intensive tasks. Efficient IPC communication also improves responsiveness.</p>',
  ],
  development: [
    '<p>Effective Electron development involves using tools like Hot Module Replacement (HMR), development servers, and proper debugging setups. Use electron-reload for automatic restarts during development.</p>',
    '<p>Debugging Electron applications can be done using Chrome DevTools for the renderer process and standard Node.js debugging tools for the main process.</p>',
    '<p>Development workflow includes separate configurations for development and production, proper error handling, and using build tools to automate repetitive tasks.</p>',
    '<p>Testing Electron applications involves unit tests for business logic, integration tests for IPC communication, and end-to-end tests for user interactions.</p>',

  maintenance: [
    '<p>Managing Electron versions is important for stability and security. Regularly update to newer versions to get security patches and performance improvements.</p>',
    '<p>Testing your application thoroughly after version upgrades and maintain a consistent version across your team to avoid compatibility issues.</p>',
    '<p>Keeping dependencies updated helps maintain security and performance. Use tools like npm audit to identify vulnerable packages.</p>',
    '<p>Documentation and code organization are important for long-term maintenance of Electron applications.</p>',
